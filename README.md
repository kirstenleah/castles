# üè∞ Castle's For Sale üè∞

## Summary / MVP

This app will be a site to purchase real estate, but only for castles.

We will be using React.js (front end), JavaScript, React Routing, Fetch, RESTful Routes (Full CRUD), Ruby, Rails (back end) API, Heroku, NPM, Node.js, and Postgres-sql.

## User Story

1. Open the app and a log in form is rendered. You may put in your account info (user name, password), then press enter. Alternatively, you can create a new account by clicking the new account button.

2. This displays the home page. There is a navigation bar at the top with links to you're account(liked castles), log off and search (search will include castles for sale, and purchased castles). Below is a scrolling down, list of castles with their photo, cost, location, description and title.

3. If you select one of the castles displayed for sale on the home page you may like it or buy it. After you do either action you are routed to your account page.

4. The account page displays all of your liked castles and purchased castles. You may removed castles from your liked section. The navigation bar at this page displays home, search and log off.

5. If you click search you are routed to a page that lets you search by cost, location or title. The nav bar now displays home, account and log off.

6. If log out is selected you are routed to initial page displaying log in form.
