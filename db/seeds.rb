      'Ever thought about owning your own private island off the coast of Pembrokeshire? Well this is the ideal opportunity for you!!! The chance has arisen to purchase your very own Grade 2 listed fort off the coastal town of Milford Haven which history states was constructed between the years of 1850 ‚Äì 1852. It was constructed as a gun fort with the design and idea to protect the town of Milford Haven if ever invasion were to take place. The gun fort was disarmed in 1929 however original features are still in place. The best thing we can suggest to get a more visual representation of the property is to view the fantastic drone video above and here you will be able to see the exact fort as it now currently stands.',
